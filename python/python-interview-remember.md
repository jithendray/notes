# Things to remember for interviews

- **sets in python do not maintain order** i.e. when u add elements to set and later retrieve them - the order might not be same as the original list.
- `XOR (^)` - use for problems involving finding unique elements among duplicates
	- x ^ x = 0
	- x ^ 0 = x
	- The order in which XOR is applied doesn't matter!
